# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of the School District Analysis was to clean, sort, and analyze data from the city school district in order to uncover trends in relation to standardized test scores, school funding, and school size and type. We performed detailed analysis of two csv files, one containing student information and one containing school information, which we then merged. The data we discovered using PANDAS and Jupyter notebook included:
- The top 5 performing schools
- The bottom 5 performing schools
- School performance based on budget
- School performance based on school size
- School performance based on the type of school (District or Charter)

However, the analysis showed evidence of academic dishonesty, specifically in one area. So we then performed a second analysis, this time with the 9th graders from Thomas High School's test scores replaced with NaN and we explored how this altered our data.
